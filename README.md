Created a simple Tic Tac Toe game in C++
 - user is represented my a 'X' mark and the computer is represented by 'O'
 - Created a simple plan and used nothing fancy or complex
 - Used conditionals, loops both 'while' and 'for'
 - Version 1 of this, planning more projects and might make this more complex and aesthically pleasing
